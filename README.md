## About project

This repo is a place we collaborate on writing a book on Django in Kyrgyz. To our knowledge, it's going to be the first book in Kyrgyz using CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) license. The book will showcase Django features based on simple projects in a beginner–friendly manner.

## Book plan

The book will consist of the following parts:

1. A simple project which will look like the official Poll tutorial.
2. A blog-project with basic CRUD + authorization, permissions and registration.
3. Continuation of the previous project where we'll add DRF and Docker (with Docker Compose) to the project.
4. Deployment using Docker and CI/CD integration (TBD)

Contributions are welcome :)
